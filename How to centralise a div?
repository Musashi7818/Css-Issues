There is some ways to centralise things in css.
For exemple: 

Centralising something there is inside the box (Body>div, div>p...)
body{
  height: 100vh; #height to align
}
div{
  display: flex; #to generate a flexbox
  justify-content: center; #to make it horizontaly centralised
  align-itens: center; #to make it verticaly centralised
}

But if we wana chose a specific thing and change it position just changin it style we need to use for exemple:
body{
  
}
div{
  position: absolute; #make changes using page point of view
  top: 50%; #distance btween top
  left: 50%; #distance between left
  transform; translate(-50%, -50%); #to make it really centralized
}
